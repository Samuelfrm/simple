This is a toy language called Simple which compiler generates a form of assembly
running on the Simple Virtual Machine, which is part of this project. The original code was written by Anthony A. Aaby. I beleive his book is in the public domain.
The book's title is  "Compiler Construction using Flex and Bison".

This is a toy programming language called Simple which compiler generates a form of assembler
running on the Simple Virtual Machine, which is also part of this project. The original code was written by Anthony A. Aaby, who presented it as compiler and VM examples in his papers ( that I beleive be in the public domain ) 
titled  "Compiler Construction using Flex and Bison".
